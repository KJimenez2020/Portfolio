# Portfolio
Hello! To whomever is reading this, this is my currently under-construction GitHub portfolio.
The first project I have listed on here is a fluid dynamics simulation I created to simulate inflation of an atypical airbag, with the goal of picking design parameters without needing to physically prototype. This project was motivated by my current senior design project at Columbia University where my group is working on advanced avalanche airbags. 
The second project is part of my work with Professor Dan Westervelt and the Westervelt Aerosol Group at Columbia. The explanations of how the code works and the motivations are far less thorough than the airbag notebook, however it is a project I have worked on for far longer and shows more of my coding style. 
This page is still under construction so I apologize for any rough edges.
