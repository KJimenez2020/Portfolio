# Portfolio
Hello! To whomever is reading this, this is my currently under-construction GitHub portfolio.

The first project I have listed on here is a fluid dynamics simulation I created to simulate inflation of an atypical airbag, with the goal of picking design parameters without needing to physically prototype. This project was motivated by my current senior design project at Columbia University where my group is working on advanced avalanche airbags. 

The second project is part of my work with Professor Dan Westervelt and the Westervelt Aerosol Group at Columbia. It features the data analysis, visualization, and regression work that led to the American Geophysical Union (AGU) poster A21A-1667: "Performance evaluation of 10 PM2.5 air sensor systems at an urban core and urban downwind site in New York". The explanations of how the code works and the motivations are less thorough than the airbag notebook, however it is a project I have worked on for far longer and shows more of my coding style so I felt it warranted addition.
